# I was able to identify the sequence as the fibonacci sequence,
# but i am bad at math and was unsure of how to begin.
# I use int(input()) in order to convert the datatype to an integer, since input() always returns a string.  
# I largely followed this tutorial from stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3953749/python-fibonacci-generator
# I then modifidied it to return add 0 efter every number sequence using string concatenation, and to return a string instead of a list
# Line 14 is used to remove the last 0, which is not present in the example sequence, decreased indent so it only occurs once.
