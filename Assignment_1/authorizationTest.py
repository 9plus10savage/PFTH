# I wanted the function to keep attempting to validate the password. I initially tried using a loop,
# but decided to create another function, which could then repeatedly call itself upon wrong input.
# I wanted to use local variables, and thus i needed to pass the (optional) password argument through to passwordCheck as well.
# I used conditional statements for controlling the flow.
